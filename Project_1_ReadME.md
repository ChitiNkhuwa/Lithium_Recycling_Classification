Spent Lithium-ion Battery Recycling (SLIBR) Classification

1.Overview

This project aims to classify spent lithium-ion batteries into cathode and anode mineral classes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The classification model is trained on a dataset of images representing different types of spent lithium-ion batteries.

2.Features

CNN architecture implemented in PyTorch.
Dataset consisting of labeled images of spent lithium-ion batteries.
Training script for training the classification model.
Evaluation script for assessing the model's performance on validation images.

3.Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib
