# Spent Lithium-ion Battery Recycling (SLIBR) Classification

This project aims to classify spent lithium-ion batteries into cathode and anode mineral classes using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The classification model is trained on a dataset of images representing different types of spent lithium-ion batteries.

## Features

- CNN architecture implemented in PyTorch.
- Dataset consisting of labeled images of spent lithium-ion batteries.
- Training script for training the classification model.
- Evaluation script for assessing the model's performance on validation images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Results

Accuracy of the network on the validation images: 80%

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters.
- Explore techniques to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.
- Expand the dataset to improve model robustness and accuracy.
