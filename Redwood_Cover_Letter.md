# Cover Letter: Chiti Nkhuwa

## Introduction
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I'm showcasing my passion for data science and machine learning. My name is Chiti Nkhuwa, and I'm thrilled to introduce myself to you.

## About Me
I'm a dedicated data scientist with a strong background in business analytics and a knack for leveraging machine learning to tackle real-world problems. With a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and a Master's degree in Business Analytics, I bring a unique blend of analytical skills and business acumen to the table.
I have extensive experience working with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, as well as proficiency in Python, Pandas, and NumPy for data analysis and modeling.

## Why Redwood Materials?
After a conversation with a recruiter several months back, I became acquainted with Redwood Materials' ambitious mission to establish a sustainable battery supply chain. This encounter ignited a passion within me to contribute my skills to such a significant endeavor. Though the discussion initially revolved around another role, the notion of joining a team during a pivotal growth phase and engaging in sustainability projects has lingered in my mind ever since.
Additionally, engaging with individuals who have transitioned to Redwood Materials further solidified my belief in the company's commitment to fostering a people-oriented and growth-centric environment. This ethos closely resonates with my career aspirations, as I am eager to collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals dedicated to effecting positive change in the world.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on special projects at Redwood Materials involving complex sensor and imagery data, such as x-ray scans, 3D imaging, and spectrometry data.
## Projects
### Project 1: Spent Lithium-ion Battery Recycling (SLIBR) Classification
- Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture using PyTorch to classify spent lithium-ion batteries into cathode and anode mineral classes.
- Curated and preprocessed a dataset containing labeled images of various types of spent lithium-ion batteries for model training.
- Implemented training and evaluation scripts to train the classification model and assess its performance on validation images.

### Project 2: Spatial Clustering of Mineral Resource Mines
- Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to spatially cluster mineral resource mines using their longitude and latitude coordinates.
- Utilized the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset, enabling effective spatial analysis of mining activities.
- Leveraged a dataset containing operational details of mineral resource mines, including geographical coordinates and mine types, to perform the spatial clustering analysis.

I have several more projects, most of which are centered around mining, energy and sustainability.

## Conclusion
Thank you for taking the time to review my GitHub repository and learn more about my journey as a data scientist. I'm excited about the possibility of joining the talented team at Redwood Materials and contributing to the mission of sustainability and innovation.
